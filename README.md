Indexed knowledge bases with command-line tools for agents.

A wiki keeps project knowledge as plain markdown, indexed at every level by
`_index.md` files, read by consulting the index and opening only the pages that
a task needs. Andrej Karpathy named this shape the
[LLM Wiki](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f)
pattern, and Google's
[Open Knowledge Format](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-the-open-knowledge-format-can-improve-data-sharing)
describes a standardized format for such markdown knowledge bases. Most
approaches leave a great deal of structuring for agents to maintain by hand;
here a deterministic CLI generates the indexes and cross-links and auto-resolves
the generated region of `_index.md` merges when parallel edits collide —
authored content below the delimiter still merges (and can conflict) like any
other text — so content is the only judgment call.

## Installation

Install the `wiki` package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install plasma-wiki
```

Use `pipx install` or `uv tool install` to install the package in an isolated
environment.

### Skill

Install the skill for your agent via the plugin marketplace (Claude Code and
Codex):

```bash
# Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add plasma-ai/plugins
/plugin install wiki@plasma

# Codex
codex plugin marketplace add plasma-ai/plugins
codex plugin add wiki@plasma
```

Another install route is from the CLI, which copies (or symlinks) the skill into
`~/.claude/skills` and `~/.agents/skills` (add `--project` for the current
project only):

```bash
wiki install [--link]
```

After upgrading the package, re-run `wiki install` to refresh the copied skill
(pass `--link` for symlinked install).

## Usage

A wiki is a tree of markdown files linked together by `_index.md` files. Each
folder becomes a section, and each markdown file becomes an entry. Wikis are
designed to be read and written by both humans and agents: humans author content
in Obsidian (or any editor), and agents query the wiki through the CLI to ground
their work in project-specific knowledge.

Every wiki root carries a `.wiki/` directory — the tool's namespace, holding
`settings.json` (the file that declares the root; `wiki init` writes it and
`wiki update` restores a missing one), the derived word counts cache, and the
staged Obsidian config. Page, folder, and wiki names are lenient by default:
spaces, dashes, mixed case, and unicode are all fine. Only characters that would
break the wiki's structure — its path, link, and index syntax — are rejected,
along with leading dots (hidden files) and the reserved `_index` name. A wiki
can opt into stricter rules, such as ASCII-only or identifier-style names,
through the `naming` block in `.wiki/settings.json`; `wiki lint` flags any name
that violates the policy.

Frontmatter timestamps default to UTC in ISO-8601. To change them, set a
timezone (any IANA name) and format (a strftime string) under `timestamp` in
`.wiki/settings.json`. The stamps are tool-owned: `created:` is written when a
file gains frontmatter and kept from then on, and `updated:` is rewritten on
every actual write. A hand edit goes undetected unless the value stops parsing
under the configured format — `wiki lint` fails an unparseable stamp.

Display names are path-derived: `wiki update` owns each entry's `name:`
frontmatter and rewrites the H1 heading to match. An optional authored `title:`
field — on any index or page — overrides the H1 while `name` stays tool-owned;
set `title: null` (or delete the line) to unset it. Setting `titles.required` in
`.wiki/settings.json` demands an authored title everywhere: `wiki update` seeds
a `title: null` placeholder on every entry missing one and `wiki lint` fails
each placeholder until a title is authored.

Word counts shown by `wiki map` are computed from page bodies and cached in
`.wiki/cache/word_counts.json` under the wiki root — never stored in
frontmatter, so editing a page dirties nothing else. The cache directory ignores
itself via its own `.gitignore` and can be deleted at any time; it is rebuilt on
demand. In the map, a page shows its own count and a folder shows `page/tree`
(its index's words over the subtree total), abbreviated with `k`/`m` suffixes
past a thousand. Descriptions print in full by default — `--desc-limit` (or the
`map.desc_limit` setting) caps them to a character budget, and `-1` forces no
truncation — while `wiki map --stat` sizes the dump (lines, chars, words)
without printing it. The map's indent unit and truncation marker are
configurable via `map.indent` and `map.ellipsis` in `.wiki/settings.json`.

### CLI

Use the `/wiki` skill to manage wikis, or drive the `wiki` CLI directly.

Initialize a wiki in the current project and configure integrations:

- `wiki init` — scaffold a new wiki with a root index
- `wiki config` — install Obsidian plugins and the git merge driver

The merge driver itself lives in each clone's local git config; the committed
`.gitattributes` only names it, so every contributor runs `wiki config` once
after cloning.

A wiki may define a `.wiki/wiki.py` hook — a custom `Wiki` subclass the tool
loads to change indexing or formatting. Because the hook runs code with your
privileges, `wiki` refuses to load one from a wiki you have not trusted (every
command that resolves the wiki fails, naming the hook) and points you at:

- `wiki trust` — authorize the enclosing wiki to run its `.wiki/wiki.py`

Run it once from inside a wiki whose contents you have vetted; it records the
wiki's resolved root in `~/.wiki/settings.json` (override the config home with
`WIKI_CONFIG_DIR`). A wiki with no hook needs no trust. Never trust a wiki
cloned from an untrusted source without first reading its `.wiki/wiki.py`.

Maintain indexes as files are added and removed:

- `wiki lint` — validate structure and flag issues
- `wiki update` — sync index links with the filesystem

`wiki lint` exits 1 on issues and 0 on a clean wiki (soft notes go to stderr and
never affect the exit code — a stale wikilink in prose is a note, while a broken
link in a generated index block is an issue). A page that must display
otherwise-flagged content — sample conflict markers, stale link examples — wraps
those lines in a `<!-- start: no-lint -->` ... `<!-- end: no-lint -->` region,
which suppresses the positional rules, notes included, for just that span.

Browse structure, search across content, and read entries:

- `wiki map` — print an indented tree overview
- `wiki search` — search content with regex
- `wiki read` — read a named entry

Commands other than `init` operate on the enclosing wiki when run from inside
one (the root is the ancestor declaring itself with `.wiki/settings.json`; an
undeclared index tree resolves to its outermost `_index.md`, unless the tree
encloses a declared root — then resolution refuses and directs you to that
root), or else on the `wiki/` folder under the current directory; pass `--path`
to target another wiki. `map`, `search`, `update`, and `lint` accept an optional
name argument to restrict scope to a subtree. Run `wiki --help` and
`wiki <command> --help` for full option descriptions.

### Formatters

The `***` delimiter and `[[wikilinks]]` are load-bearing syntax:
mdformat/prettier-style hooks rewrite `***` to `---` and backslash-escape the
brackets, demoting the generated link block to plain text. `wiki update` repairs
a mangled index and `wiki lint` names the damage signatures (escaped wikilinks,
a thematic break standing where `***` belongs), but don't rely on the repair —
pick a lane.

For mdformat, add the [mdformat-wiki](https://pypi.org/project/mdformat-wiki/)
plugin, which teaches it to leave wikilinks, frontmatter, and the `***`
delimiter untouched, so wiki faces round-trip byte-identically. Under
pre-commit:

```yaml
- id: mdformat
  additional_dependencies: [mdformat-wiki]
```

If the hook already lists `mdformat-frontmatter`, remove it — both plugins
register a frontmatter renderer and whichever the environment discovers first
wins; when `mdformat-frontmatter` wins, it re-serializes the YAML (quoting
values, blanking `null`s) instead of leaving it untouched.

For formatters with no plugin lane, exclude the wiki root instead — for
prettier, add it to `.prettierignore`:

```text
wiki/
```

## Development

### Install

Run `install.sh` in the package root. With no environment active it creates and
uses a local `.venv`; with one active (e.g. pyenv) it installs into that
environment (editable), without recreating it:

```bash
./install.sh --all-extras --groups=test,lint,type
```

Run `./install.sh --help` for all options. Alternatively, run
`uv sync --all-extras --group test --group lint --group type` and
`uv run pre-commit install` to set up the environment manually.

Installing a dependency as editable (e.g. a sibling package) is left to the
caller: `uv pip install --editable <path>`.

With an editable install, `wiki install --link` symlinks the bundled skill into
the agent skill directories instead of copying it, so skill edits apply without
re-running the install.

Once installed, run tools with `uv run --no-sync <command>`, or activate the
environment first (`source .venv/bin/activate`).

### Tests

Run the test suite:

```bash
pytest .
```

### Linting

Run linters and formatters:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Third-Party Software

`wiki` sets up the
[Front Matter Title](https://github.com/snezhig/obsidian-front-matter-title)
Obsidian plugin by Snezhig, which displays each note's `name` frontmatter as its
title. The plugin is licensed GPL-3.0; `wiki init`/`wiki config` download
version 4.1.0 from the upstream GitHub release at setup time rather than
redistributing it.
